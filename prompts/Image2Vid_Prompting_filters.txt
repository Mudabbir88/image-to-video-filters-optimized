Cinematic street serum shot:😊
A dynamic, sunlit urban street scene unfolds in the foreground, dominated by a hand holding a small, serum bottle labeled “BEET + VITAMIN A SERUM SHOT” — the product is presented as the central, human-centered focal point, its glossy surface catching the light as if it were a beacon of modern skincare innovation. The hand gently grips the bottle, fingers slightly curled around its base, subtly shifting to maintain steady focus on the product, while the background blurs into a bustling metropolis — the camera’s shallow depth of field isolates the serum, drawing the viewer’s attention to its form and color without distraction. The setting is a wide, cobblestone street lined with historic stone buildings on either side, their facades weathered yet elegant, contrasting with the sleek, glass-and-steel skyscrapers piercing the sky in the distance — a juxtaposition of old-world charm and contemporary ambition. Two iconic red double-decker buses glide slowly along the road, adding motion and life to the scene, while pedestrians walk in soft, blurred motion, their forms indistinct but contributing to the atmosphere of a vibrant, active city. The lighting is bright, natural daylight with soft, diffused clouds overhead, casting gentle shadows and enhancing , which stands out against the neutral tones of the pavement and architecture. The color palette is a harmonious blend , cool grays, and earthy stone tones, punctuated by the bold red of the buses and the crisp white of the bottle’s cap — creating a visually balanced, aesthetically pleasing composition. The camera remains steady, held at eye level, with a slight forward tilt to emphasize the product’s presence, while the background’s motion and depth create a subtle sense of movement and energy. The overall mood is aspirational, clean, and contemporary — evoking the idea of urban sophistication meeting personal care, with a touch of playful elegance. The video’s technical execution is polished, with high-resolution clarity, natural color grading, and a cinematic feel that elevates the product into a symbol of modern beauty and lifestyle. The entire scene is designed to feel both intimate and expansive — a moment of personal ritual captured within the grandeur of city life.

slimmy squishing 2:😊😊
Subject: The main subject is the same person visible in the input image, their identity, facial structure, skin tone, hairstyle, and clothing remain fully consistent. The subject stands naturally at the center of the frame, with realistic human proportions and photorealistic details. Calm, emotionally grounded, and neutral at the start.

Scene: Neutral and uncluttered, visually consistent with the original environment, allowing full focus on the subject and the interaction.

Material: The subject behaves like dense, dry kaolin or china clay—solid, heavy, and pliable. Surface is matte, powdery, and compact. The subject resists deformation but can be lifted and fully compressed. Deformations hold realistic clay-like texture, with visible dents and finger impressions. Not elastic, not slimy, no flowing or stretching.

Motion: Begins with near-complete stillness. The subject is centered and stable, with only micro-movements. 

The camera is fixed, first-person viewpoint, no zoom, pan, tilt, or perspective change.

From the left and right edges of the frame, only fingertips enter the scene (no palms or wrists). The fingertips **grip the subject firmly and lift it completely off its base**, showing realistic weight and gravity. The lift is smooth, controlled, and full-body.

While held, the fingertips **compress and pinch the subject fully from front and back**, flattening it evenly along the main axis. The deformation is **pronounced but still clay-like**, forming dents, folds, and impressions. Partial or full identity deformation is allowed. 

After the full press, the subject **gradually rebounds to its original shape**, slowly restoring form with realistic gravity and clay-like memory. Finger impressions and creases remain visible. No bounce, no slime, no fluid motion.

Motion remains continuous, physically realistic, and grounded throughout, ending with a dense, sculpted, clay-like result.



Happy New Year:🥳🥳

the subject stands naturally at the center of the frame,
realistic human proportions and photorealistic facial details are preserved,
the subject appears calm at first, emotionally present and grounded.

Same scene

Motion: The video begins with the subject standing calmly in the original scene, centered and stable, with subtle breathing and natural micro-movements.

A small moment of physical preparation occurs:
the subject shifts weight forward slightly, knees bend minimally, the upper body leans forward just enough to signal intent.

The subject then pushes off the ground naturally, initiating a smooth forward-and-upward trajectory, driven by a single, controlled launch of the legs.

As the subject becomes airborne, a soft trail of smoke emits from behind or beneath the subject, naturally following the direction of motion. The smoke behaves like light, wispy vapor, slightly curling and dispersing in the air, visually emphasizing speed and lift without obstructing the subject.

The motion is continuous and fluid, not abrupt, not explosive, not vertical. The subject moves forward through space while gaining gentle lift.

The camera follows the subject precisely, maintaining a consistent distance and framing, tracking forward instead of zooming out.

As the subject stabilizes into a balanced flying posture, arms relaxed, body aligned, no flapping, no exaggerated movement. Clothing and hair respond naturally to airflow, reinforcing speed and direction.

The surrounding environment moves past the subject, creating a strong sense of forward momentum and elevation. The smoke continues to trail subtly, adding a cinematic and dynamic visual accent.

The subject remains clearly human at all times, with no transformation, no wings, no animal traits.

The motion settles into a smooth glide, calm, controlled, and cinematic, ending with the subject moving confidently through open space with a trailing smoke effect.

Constraints:
No fantasy anatomy.
No animal resemblance.
No wings or feathers.
No hovering in place.
Motion must follow realistic momentum and gravity.
Smoke must appear natural, subtle, and follow the trajectory of flight without dominating the scene.
